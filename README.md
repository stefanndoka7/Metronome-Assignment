# Assigment 1
This project is my first graded C++ assignment! 
Since I chose my interest to be 'metronomes', I made a program that asks for the last song the user listened to, its beats per minute, and its length. 
How long a song may be is irrelevant for the purposes of a metronome, but asking for the song name and its bpm wouldn't be enough to fulfill what the assignment was asking for.

The program then outputs a message that contains the inputs and some new information related to the inputs, the total beats of the song and the length of one beat in seconds. 

## UPDATE: 10/28/2025 

-added input validation that will cause the program to close if the user inputs invalid inputs for the integers 

-updated the output to have a table style format using setw

-added functionality to save the output of the program as a txt file titled "report.txt"


## UPDATE: 11/2/2025

-added more robust input validation using relational operators 

-added a crude menu using the switch statement (loops and functions have not been discussed yet so I could not use them, making this program look messy. This will be fixed next week when we learn loops)

## UPDATE 11/16/2025

-added loops and functions to enhance the menu
